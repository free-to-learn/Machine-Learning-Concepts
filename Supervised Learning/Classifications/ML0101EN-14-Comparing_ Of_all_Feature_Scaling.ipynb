These two\ncharacteristics lead to difficulties to visualize the data and, more\nimportantly, they can degrade the predictive performance of many machine\nlearning algorithms. Unscaled data can also slow down or even prevent the\nconvergence of many gradient-based estimators.\n\nIndeed many estimators are designed with the assumption that each feature takes\nvalues close to zero or more importantly that all features vary on comparable\nscales. In particular, metric-based and gradient-based estimators often assume\napproximately standardized data (centered features with unit variances). A\nnotable exception are decision tree-based estimators that are robust to\narbitrary scaling of the data.\n\nThis example uses different scalers, transformers, and normalizers to bring the\ndata within a pre-defined range.\n\nScalers are linear (or more precisely affine) transformers and differ from each\nother in the way to estimate the parameters used to shift and scale each\nfeature.\n\n``QuantileTransformer`` provides non-linear transformations in which distances\nbetween marginal outliers and inliers are shrunk. ``PowerTransformer`` provides\nnon-linear transformations in which data is mapped to a normal distribution to\nstabilize variance and minimize skewness.\n\nUnlike the previous transformations, normalization refers to a per sample\ntransformation instead of a per feature transformation.\n\nThe following code is a bit verbose, feel free to jump directly to the analysis\nof the results_.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Author:  Raghav RV <rvraghav93@gmail.com>\n#          Guillaume Lemaitre <g.lemaitre58@gmail.com>\n#          Thomas Unterthiner\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import minmax_scale\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n\nprint(__doc__)\n\ndataset = fetch_california_housing()\nX_full, y_full = dataset.data, dataset.target\n\n# Take only 2 features to make visualization easier\n# Feature of 0 has a long tail distribution.\n# Feature 5 has a few but very large outliers.\n\nX = X_full[:, [0, 5]]\n\ndistributions = [\n    ('Unscaled data', X),\n    ('Data after standard scaling',\n        StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after min-max scaling',\n        MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after max-abs scaling',\n        MaxAbsScaler().fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after robust scaling',\n        RobustScaler(quantile_range=(25, 75)).fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after power transformation (Yeo-Johnson)',\n     PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson').fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after power transformation (Box-Cox)',\n     PowerTransformer(method='box-cox').fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after quantile transformation (gaussian pdf)',\n        QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='normal')\n        .fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after quantile transformation (uniform pdf)',\n        QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='uniform')\n        .fit_transform(X)),\n    ('Data after sample-wise L2 normalizing',\n        Normalizer().fit_transform(X)),\n]\n\n# scale the output between 0 and 1 for the colorbar\ny = minmax_scale(y_full)\n\n# plasma does not exist in matplotlib < 1.5\ncmap = getattr(cm, 'plasma_r', cm.hot_r)\n\ndef create_axes(title, figsize=(16, 6)):\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\n    fig.suptitle(title)\n\n    #
